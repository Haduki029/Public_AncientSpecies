  <AS_WAE_Race.description>Ancient Elves are a race that live on some remote planets. \n They have four times the lifespan of humans, and due to the functioning of a special organ, they have excellent physical abilities. \nAlthough there are very few of them and they are traded at high prices, they are a race that is often hostile. \n Half-elves are said to be a race created based on this ancient elf, but there are some theories that the ancient elves themselves were created using ancient technology. </AS_WAE_Race.description>
